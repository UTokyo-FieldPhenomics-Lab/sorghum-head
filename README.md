please cite the paper below if you used the dataset provided here.

We provide three different types of in Supplementary Materials: 
1. Supplementary Materials 1:
   1)	Original image dataset 0, 17 training images for color feature selection.
   2)	DTSM_trainingData.txt, Selected color features in CSV format for generate DTSM model
2. Supplementary Materials 2, the simplest way to play with those data is to run matlab app [here](https://jp.mathworks.com/products/statistics/classification-learner.html):
   1) featureTable_croped_img_rand_201808.csv
3. Supplementary Materials 3:
   1)	original image dataset 1 and corresponded Dot labeled data (52 cropped images).
   2)	original image dataset 2 and corresponded Dot labeled data (40 plot images).
